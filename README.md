## About me

  I'm currently finishing a nursinng career, while trying to reconnect whith some old high school's knowledge to expand my skills and broaden my field of action.
  I think a lot about the meaning of this reality and how the world ended up like ***this***.-
  I love to learn conceptual things and imagining all the little parts of a system working together.... buuuuuuuuut  practical-tecnical skills are a bit out of my hands... for now!

## Why I'm here üóíÔ∏è

  In chool, I have a short experience with C++ for Arduino, HTML-CSS, JavaScript, Visual Basic, and my favorite!: assembler for PIC 18F16887. I  worked on a thermostat (temperature and humidity) and  automated lighting with sensors for a two-story house using this PIC, it was a challenge, I remember to thinking 'using an arduino would be easier for this one' like a thousand times, but the last proyect had to be in assembler... in the end, I loved the language. I found a huge challenge in trying to make "functions" for my loops, an maybe that's what I liked about it.
  The other languages didn't wow me as much; I preffered to calculete HFC links and dealing with  atennuation.... I know, I would never gonna be the popular kidd.-
  
  When the studies over, this little boy didn't practice his programming skills any more, and like anything in life, , -**if we don't use it, it will be forgotten.**-


  Years later, I had the wonderful oportunitty to work in a telecommunications company as an administrative assitant of a HFC proyect.
  The administrative job is tough sometines. The routine could be a serial killer for some of us; but ***I love*** the custommer service-part of that job! I like to be nice with other people, and organizing thigs!
  I was interested in being more active in the proyect, so I looked into becoming a designer. So I learn the basics of the coaxial desing and digitalization in an Aegis-environment.
  Like always, reality wasn't as exciting as I imagined. The calculus, the theorical knowledge didn't matter as much as I believe, the majority was done by programs D':
         I felt a little 'bobo'.

Now here I am, planning a 2025 full of study, to end the nursing's school, and ***üéµ looking for a path that was already written in my hands üéµ*** , well, just learning some new programming skills


# When to talk to me: (unordered list) 

- To share some interesting projects and have a look at of them, or maybe to "try to diy"  or collaborate. -I like just to watch üëÄ-
- To talk about IT's stuff (I'm new in this field so, give me a shoot!)
- For anything that you would think that I might be able to help you with
- For nursing talk.

**Any corrections about my projects, concept misstakes  and misspellings are ***always welcome**** ***if*** they came in a good spirits**
